Preprocessing was performed using *QSIPrep* 0.14.3,
which is based on *Nipype* 1.6.1
(@nipype1; @nipype2; RRID:SCR_002502).

Anatomical data preprocessing

: The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU)
using `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4, ANTs 2.3.1],
and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped using `antsBrainExtraction.sh`
(ANTs 2.3.1), using OASIS as target template.
Brain surfaces were reconstructed using `recon-all` [FreeSurfer 6.0.1,
RRID:SCR_001847, @fs_reconall], and the brain mask estimated
previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile
ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical
gray-matter of Mindboggle [RRID:SCR_002438, @mindboggle].
Spatial normalization to the ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical
template version 2009c [@mni, RRID:SCR_008796] was performed
through nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration`
[ANTs 2.3.1, RRID:SCR_004757, @ants], using
brain-extracted versions of both T1w volume and template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `FAST` [FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, RRID:SCR_002823,
@fsl_fast].


Diffusion data preprocessing

: Any images with a b-value less than 100 s/mm^2 were treated as a *b*=0 image. MP-PCA denoising as implemented in MRtrix3's `dwidenoise`[@dwidenoise1] was applied with a 5-voxel window. After MP-PCA, Gibbs unringing was performed using MRtrix3's `mrdegibbs` [@mrdegibbs]. Following unringing, B1 field inhomogeneity was corrected using `dwibiascorrect` from MRtrix3 with the N4 algorithm [@n4]. After B1 bias correction, the mean intensity of the DWI series was adjusted so all the mean intensity of the b=0 images matched across eachseparate DWI scanning sequence.

FSL (version 6.0.3:b862cdd5)'s eddy was used for head motion correction and Eddy current correction [@anderssoneddy]. Eddy was configured with a $q$-space smoothing factor of 10, a total of 5 iterations, and 1000 voxels used to estimate hyperparameters. A linear first level model and a linear second level model were used to characterize Eddy current-related spatial distortion. $q$-space coordinates were forcefully assigned to shells. Field offset was attempted to be separated from subject movement. Shells were aligned post-eddy. Eddy's outlier replacement was run [@eddyrepol]. Data were grouped by slice, only including values from slices determined to contain at least 250 intracerebral voxels. Groups deviating by more than 4 standard deviations from the prediction had their data replaced with imputed values. Final interpolation was performed using the `jac` method.

Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
preprocessed DWI: framewise displacement (FD) using the
implementation in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also
placed within the corresponding confounds file. Slicewise cross correlation
was also calculated.
The DWI time-series were resampled to ACPC,
generating a *preprocessed DWI run in ACPC space* with 1.2mm isotropic voxels.


Many internal operations of *QSIPrep* use
*Nilearn* 0.8.1 [@nilearn, RRID:SCR_001362] and
*Dipy* [@dipy].
For more details of the pipeline, see [the section corresponding
to workflows in *QSIPrep*'s documentation](https://qsiprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html "QSIPrep's documentation").
